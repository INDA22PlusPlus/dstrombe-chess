// If one dyn Trait was 1 byte, another was 100 bytes, and another was 5 bytes, you couldn't 
// address any trait object's data with just vec[n] in constant time, because there's no rule 
// what data starts where â€” after all each size is dynamic known only at runtime, so the Vec 
// would need to scan and measure all n-1 elements to know where the nth one starts.
